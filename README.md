# BostonHouse
In this project, I tried to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the most well-known Boston housing dataset and visualise the results. A multiple linear regressor that forecasts the cost of the homes has also been fitted by me.

## About Boston House
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the Boston Housing dataset using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques and fitting a multiple linear regression model to predict the prices of the houses. The dataset contains information about 506 census tracts of Boston from the 1970 census, and it includes various features such as per capita crime rate, proportion of residential land, nitric oxides concentration, etc., with the median value of owner-occupied homes being the target variable.

## Basic insights
The insights gained from the analysis include the range and mean of the median value of homes in the Boston suburbs, the distribution of median home values, and the correlation between the median value of homes and various features such as the average number of rooms per dwelling and residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet. The analysis also shows the impact of Charles River dummy variable, accessibility to radial highways, distance to employment centers, and nitrogen oxide concentration in air on the median value of homes.

## Conclusion

Finally, the project includes a multiple linear regression model that predicts the price of the house, and the code is available in an ipnyb file.
